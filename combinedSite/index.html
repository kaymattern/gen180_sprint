        <p id=topPPA>Third-party ownership is one of the primary ways schools finance solar energy.</p>
        
        <span id=PPAexplain>In third-party ownership, a third party finances, builds, owns, and maintains the solar system under a lease or power purchasing agreement (PPA). PPA arrangements enable the host  school to avoid many of the traditional barriers to the installation of on-site solar systems: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes. </span><br><br>
        <p id=whyPPA>Why PPAs are a great option for schools: </p><ul id=ppaAdv>
            <li>Schools lack tax liability, so are unable to take advantage of state or federal tax credits or accelerated depreciation for solar equipment. However, through PPAs the third party owner can generate tax savings and pass some of them on to the school.</li>
            <li>Schools can have solar systems with little to no upfront costs.</li>
            <li>The host school avoids many traditional barriers to on-site installation: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes.</li>
            <li>Solar PPAs can be cash flow positive for the school from the day the system is commisioned.</li>

That means the remaining 22 states only account for 9% of the solar installed on schools. Lack of access to third-party financing is stifling solar development in almost half the country.</p></span>

                <strong>EXPLAIN TUCSON CASE STUDY</strong>
                  Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
        Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
