        <p id=topPPA>Third-party ownership is one of the primary ways schools finance solar energy.</p>
        
        <span id=PPAexplain>In third-party ownership, a third party finances, builds, owns, and maintains the solar system under a lease or power purchasing agreement (PPA). PPA arrangements enable the host  school to avoid many of the traditional barriers to the installation of on-site solar systems: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes. </span><br><br>
        <p id=whyPPA>Why PPAs are a great option for schools: </p><ul id=ppaAdv>
            <li>Schools lack tax liability, so are unable to take advantage of state or federal tax credits or accelerated depreciation for solar equipment. However, through PPAs the third party owner can generate tax savings and pass some of them on to the school.</li>
            <li>Schools can have solar systems with little to no upfront costs.</li>
            <li>The host school avoids many traditional barriers to on-site installation: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes.</li>
            <li>Solar PPAs can be cash flow positive for the school from the day the system is commisioned.</li>
