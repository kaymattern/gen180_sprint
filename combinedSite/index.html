        <p id=topPPA>More than <strong>three-quarters</strong> of the cumulative solar capacity  installed on schools nationwide was funded through a form of third-party ownership.</p> <br>
        
        <span id=PPAexplain>Through third-party ownership, a third party finances, builds, owns, and maintains the solar system. These arrangements are typically structured as power purchasing agreements (PPA).  In a PPA, the school agrees to pay the solar company an agreed-upon rate for the solar power generated by the system that is typically below the market rate. The agreement can include options for the school to buy the panels at certain points during the contract term or after it ends. PPA arrangements enable the host  school to avoid many of the traditional barriers to the installation of on-site solar systems: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes. </span><br><br>
        <p id=whyPPA>Why PPAs are a great option for schools: </p><ul id=ppaAdv>
            <li>Schools lack tax liability, so are unable to take advantage of state or federal tax credits or accelerated depreciation for solar equipment. However, through PPAs the third party owner can generate tax savings and pass some of them on to the school.</li>
            <li>Schools can have solar systems with little to no upfront costs.</li>
            <li>The host school avoids many traditional barriers to on-site installation: high upfront capital costs, system performance risk, and complex design and permitting processes.</li>
            <li>Solar PPAs can be cash flow positive for the school from the day the system is commisioned.</li>

That means the remaining 22 states only account for 9% of the solar installed on schools.</p></span>

                <p id=topTucson>Success Story in Tucson, Arizona</p>
                  The solar project at the Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) delivers solar energy to 80 schools and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 38.7 million pounds per year. TUSD paid nothing upfront for the system (financed entirely by third-party power purchase agreements), and it projects energy cost savings of up to $43 million over 20 years.
